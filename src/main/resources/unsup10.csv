0_u	"I admit, the great majority of films released before say 1933 are just not for me. Of the dozen or so ""major"" silents I have viewed, one I loved (The Crowd), and two were very good (The Last Command and City Lights, that latter Chaplin circa 1931).<br /><br />So I was apprehensive about this one, and humor is often difficult to appreciate (uh, enjoy) decades later. I did like the lead actors, but thought little of the film.<br /><br />One intriguing sequence. Early on, the guys are supposed to get ""de-loused"" and for about three minutes, fully dressed, do some schtick. In the background, perhaps three dozen men pass by, all naked, white and black (WWI ?), and for most, their butts, part or full backside, are shown. Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of Howard Hughes?"
1_u	"This is a very strange film that was long thought to be forgotten. It's the story of two American Army buddies, William Boyd (aka ""Hopalong Cassidy"") and Louis Wolheim, and their adventures as they manage to escape from a German prison camp during WWI. However, as this is a comedy, the duo manage to make the most round about and stupid escape--accidentally boarding a train to Constantinople to be placed in a Turkish prisoner of war camp! On the way, they manage to escape once again and end up in quite the adventure--meeting sexy Mary Astor along the way.<br /><br />As far as the film goes, it was a rather funny script and despite being a silly plot, it worked rather well. The chemistry between Boyd and Wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining. Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out Harold Lloyd's film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it's one of Lloyd's best films). Still, it's well worth a look--especially if you love silent films.<br /><br />By the way, director Milestone and Louis Walheim would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy."
24095_u	With a savage murderer stalking the night, dark suspicion swirls about THE LODGER living in a London home.<br /><br />Sir Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) became a director of note with this silent film, his first thriller and only his third directorial effort, which shows the young Master's talents being developed in embryo. Based on the novel by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes and the tales of Jack the Ripper, Hitchcock was able to embroider upon the theme of mistaken identities and incorporate an intense chase sequence, both of which would become important elements in his later suspense films. He also made the first of his famous cameo appearances, twice actually, which would also become part of his trademark.<br /><br />The film is well plotted and moody, told in an almost expressionistic style, relying mainly on visuals and a somewhat frugal use of title cards. The staging in the narrow, multi-level home is especially well managed, with characters on different stories interacting in the plot simultaneously.<br /><br />Fans of the 1944 American remake with Laird Cregar may be surprised at its very different ending from this film. This is probably largely due to the fact that the earlier movie (including some very incongruous and never explained plot elements) was planned as a showcase for its star, matinée idol Ivor Novello, who plays the title role. Born David Ivor Davies in Wales, Novello (1893-1951) was the son of famed singing teacher Dame Clara Novello Davies. He found success on the stage at an early age and became a very popular actor-manager, playwright & composer, his most lauded song being the World War One patriotic tune 'Keep The Home Fires Burning.' Although he appeared occasionally in films, Novello's greatest renown came from his acting in the lavishly romantic stage plays he authored, his handsome good looks being especially appreciated by the ladies in the audience. A hint of his melodramatic stage persona, especially the use of his mesmeric eyes, can be seen in Hitchcock's film, projecting the actor into a virtual Epiphany during the most exciting sequence. Novello would also star in THE LODGER's 1932 British talkie remake.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does well in support of Novello, especially Marie Ault & Arthur Chesney as his increasingly frightened landlords. Monosyllabic actress June flounces prettily as their flirtatious daughter; Malcolm Keen, whose character is done rather dirty by the script, plays the suspicious cop who loves her.
2_u	"William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are the ""Two Arabian Knights"" referred to in the title, humorously. The pair start out as U.S. POWs trying to escape from the Germans during World War I. Eventually, they find themselves on board a ship bound for Arabia. While tripping out to the Middle East, they rescue an Arab woman, Mary Astor, who turns out to be a Princess; and, of course, becomes a romantic interest for the ""Two Arabian Knights"". No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms. Astor!<br /><br />The film is very well photographed and directed; Lewis Milestone has wonderful sets, and stages scenes beautifully. Of the performances, Mr. Wolheim stands out - he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak, trough the film is silent. The story isn't as strong as it could be - there are some events and sequences which had me wondering how and why the characters' locale changed. The last looks, exchanged between one of the stars and an extra, is an example of something I didn't understand. Perhaps these were comic bits which had a particular appeal for the time.<br /><br />The film is damaged in several places; but there is enough preserved, in even these scenes, to allow your mind to fill in the visual blanks. Boris Karloff appears as the ""Purser""; watch for his big scene on ship, when Wolheim goes into a room with him for some money (what actually happens is a mystery). Early in the film, there is a long scene with a lot of naked men shown from the waist up (or, thereabouts); they are POWs being herded to the showers. Director Milestone uses parades of soldiers moving to great effect; this ""shower"" scene is different in that several of the men don't look as Caucasian as you might expect - maybe not as many Caucasian men would agree to appear nude? <br /><br />******* Two Arabian Knights (9/23/27) Lewis Milestone ~ William Boyd, Louis Wolheim, Mary Astor"
3_u	"Not very many movies come to my mind that covered as much geography as this one.<br /><br />Naturally, being a Hollywood product, there is not a whole lot of realism here, but there is a whole lot of entertainment, and a whole lot of talent.<br /><br />Louis Wollheim apparently never became a household name, but his performance in this film would indicate he should have.<br /><br />In one priceless scene, when, without inter-titles, the Bill Boyd character whispers the explanation of a word (often found in the Bible), Wollheim's expression almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.<br /><br />Lewis Milestone's direction is another plus. This was still early in his career, but his use of inventive angles and a moving camera showed brilliance.<br /><br />Ian Keith made a superb suave villain in one of his best roles.<br /><br />Being a silent film, ""Two Arabian Knights"" probably won't be shown even on Turner Classic Movies very often, but I urge film fans to grab any opportunity to watch it."
41716_u	"i watched this movie on TV on thursday night and I couldn't believe what i saw. this movie made me cry but for all the wrong reasons! Every 2 seconds I was saying, ""What the crap?!"" because i just couldn't believe that all those bad things could happen to Rocky so fast. I mean he just got back from Russia and he finds out that his idiot friend, Paulie, signed some paper, which made the Balboa family bankrupt! they lost their estate and all their money, and ended up living back in the area they were living in for Rocky I. I also could not believe how Rocky's son from Rocky IV looked about 8 years old when Rocky left to fight Drago, and then when he gets back, his son in Rocky V, (who is Sylvester Stallone's real-life son) looked about 13 & dorky! It seems that all Sylvester tried to do in the last 2 Rocky movies is somehow get his family involved in the movie, which is not right. Though Rocky's son in Rocky V does look more Italian, it was just not the same. I will never watch this movie again because the plot made me so angry. If they do make a Rocky VI, which i highly doubt since Sylvester Stallone is 60 now i think, i will watch it just to see how it is."
41717_u	Rocky Five is terrible beyond belief. You may think that I am being hard on it but no. It is quite possibly the worst movie ever made and is an embarrassment to be in with the rest of the series, all of which were great movies. But this one, no.<br /><br />After having defeated Drago, Rocky starts experiencing physical problems, mainly shaking beyond belief. After returning home he meets up with his son who seems to have grown by more than five years of age since the last time they saw him. Rocky holds a press conference to announce his retirement but is quickly offered an opportunity to box against a young boxer named Union Caine by a man named George Washington. Rocky says no and returns home. This is where things start to go crazy.<br /><br />Soon it is found out that Paulie gave some guy a blank check signed by Rocky or something and that they lost all their money. So they are forced to move back to Philadelphia. Further issues show up when it is revealed that Rocky has suffered head trauma and further boxing can seriously injure him (watching this movie could also give you head trauma).<br /><br />However Rocky re opens the old boxing gym since Mickey willed it over to Rocky Jr. Now living in the old neighborhood Rocky Jr. begins school and is immediately beaten up by bullies. Rocky meanwhile meets up with a young boxer named Tommy Gunn whom wants Rocky to manage him but Rocky decides he is not a good enough listener. He latter changes his mind and agrees to train Tommy Gunn and begins to spend more time with Tommy than his own son and dissension soon forms between father and son.<br /><br />TOmmy Gunn moves up the ranks. George Washington meanwhile tries to lure Gunn away from Rocky by lavishing wealth and women upon him. Rocky Jr. beats up the bullies that bugged him. Gunn leaves Rocky and immediately battles Union Caine for the heavyweight champion title and wins it. Rocky and Jr. talk and patch things up. After winning the title Gunn is hassled by reporters who argue that him winning the belt is meaningless since he never beat Rocky to obtain it and because Caine was a paper champion.<br /><br />Gunn finds Rocky at a local Bar and challenges him but Rocky says no. Paulie then taunts Gunn but gets beaten up. Rocky then agrees to fight Gunn in the streets. Getting some support from the Spirit of Mickey, Rocky beats Gunn up.<br /><br />The whole concept of Rocky losing everything he got and starting off again where he started from is pretty stupid. Also the way he lost all of his money is really ignorant. And since Paulie is supposedly the reason for them losing so much they STILL LET HIM LIVE WITH THEM!!!! Tommy Gunn is a pretty lame character. ALso a Rocky Movie with no big fight in the ring at the end is a bad idea. Rocky fighting Gunn in the ring at the end would have made this movie a little better, not much, but I guess that idea was not good.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Rocky movies stay away from this one. I got the box set of Rocky from my sister for Christmas one year but I never watch this one. FOr me Rocky five never happened.
41718_u	A lot of Rocky buffs expect viewers to suspend all disbelief, with each passing installation. You can only keep pummeling a series so much, however, without revolt. Most Rocky fans are not children anymore and can not be expected to play along as such.<br /><br />The emergence of Tommy Gunn was kind of fun, but the premise of the plot is so fabled, as to be impossible. There is no fixing this kind of disappointment.<br /><br />The only positive thing that can be said about this film is the quasi-inspiration, though prototypical, premise of sticking together and weathering the storm. The father and son dynamic is rather good in this one, making this film an installation with some merit.<br /><br />But it is all undermined by the ridiculous and highly unlikely plot points.<br /><br />Kudos for trying, I guess.
41719_u	"Being a kid in the 90s, the Rocky films have a special place in my heart. I remember in 1996, Rocky 1-4 were shown on consecutive days on TV. I was not aware that Rocky 5 existed until I bought the box set in 2002.<br /><br />I watched Rocky (9/10), Rocky 2 (9/10), Rocky 3 (8/10) and Rocky 4 (9/10) back to back and with great anticipation I placed the Rocky 5 disc into the DVD player.<br /><br />When the movie finished, I thought to myself: ""what the hell was that?"" I expected it to follow the formula of the previous rocky films (the montage, big fight at the end etc) and thought that that was the problem. I watched it the next day and had that same feeling again.<br /><br />Rocky 5 has the ""dodgy sequel effect"" on the previous films in that their quality is diminished by the fact that Rocky, our hero whom we look up to and admire for his iron chin and unbreakable spirit has been reduced to a broken down man who trains some punk kid and ignores his own kids in turn.<br /><br />This is not the Rocky we know and love, this is a derivative piece of junk that is detested by fans (both hardcore and casual). It is a waste of a film. The only reason that this has a 2/10 and not a 1/10 is that the fight at the end is pretty well choreographed.<br /><br />However. You lucky people who have not seen any Rocky films and are considering purchasing the Rocky box set have the option of not watching this and instead watching the vastly superior Rocky Balboa instead.<br /><br />Note to Stallone, Still waiting for the following films from you: Rocky 7, another Rambo and Copland 2. Oh, and give my regards to your mom."
41720_u	Spoiler Alert I have to say that when I first saw the movies Rocky 1-3, I was in bliss. The story's were brill. Something that made you never want to see the end of it, went away wishing the film had another half hour left or so. Rocky 4 was 50/50. Stallone wanted to make a movie about change, hardly see any change apart from the gloryhunter fans at the end going from Drago's to Rocky's! Dunno why they had to kill Apollo off, could've just sidelined him with injury or something, but in my view the pace and energy of the fight made up for it, and one more thing, no mention of Mickey??? Apart from the flashback sequence. And then, Rocky V. Another Rocky is always a pleasure in my view, but the movie could've been better! Stallone stated that originally Rocky was supposed to die in his last fight with tommy gunn, but changed weeks prior to production, claiming the film is about recovering from a disaster, which is a great plot to go by, but why did he have to have a street fight? I like the idea of the sadness that he ignored his son by paying loads of attention to Tommy, then tommy went awol with george duke, but at least he could have had Apollo or Creed's manager(I forget the name) train him for one last fight in the ring, and then beats tommy gunn, wins the title, and wins back his fortune. Or even he died in the ring after he beat him, and had millions cheer him on or mourn him as he went. <br /><br />Rocky VI???? nnnnnnoooooo! sly's too old, fat, slow and lost his talent in writing. 5 is enough. His career's going down the crap shoot, he should just relive his past glory and call it day. <br /><br />Oh yeah, the actor who plays Gunn should've been the one who really retired! haha.
41721_u	Rocky v has become somewhat of a curiosity to me. I read highly negative reviews for the film and expected a lame rehash of the first. I was very polarized by the moral messages it has. The film was far from perfect, and fell flat with the glum ending, so naturally, i was highly disappointed.<br /><br />Rocky loses his money and his boy begins to resent him. He moves back to the streets of Philly with Paulie and Adrian and begins to train a new fighter, Tommy Gunn. Tommy is bombarded by the press and agrees to fight professionally. He betrays Rocky and hurts Paulie. Thankfully Rocky kicks his ass.<br /><br />What i didn't like at all was the fact that rocky ended up where he started, with nothing to show for what he had achieved in the past. The film is astonishingly wrong headed<br /><br />This movie is different to the others, it has a different message, but its still the worst of the series.
41722_u	I am sick of everyone saying that rocky V sucked as well. the movie itself wasn't such a bad movie. it was ,however, extremely disappointing because after all those years of grueling training montages and hard work, Rocko loses all of his money because of Paulie's ridiculous gambling habits. its just sad to see the rock go out broke, he didn't deserve to leave cinema as a bum who let his family and friends take advantage of him. it was great tho because when he gets back from Russia later that ,probably year, his son is 5 years older. the poor kid gets picked on for being rich ,so, naturally Paulie teaches him how to fight? despite all the holes and questions seeing Rocko in street-fighter mode is just great, and seeing him kick the crap out of a well trained 25 year old is awesome.
41723_u	I'd heard a lot about this film, 99% of it good. So I picked the film up to take a gander, and was terribly disappointed. It took me two tries to even finish the film! Michael Angelis was actually quite good in the main role, and Elvis Costello was amusing in his cameo appearance as a daft magician. But the good ended there. The jokes were dated, the sound was horrid, the plot was garbled and *much* too long. Was only 1 hour 40 but felt like more than two hours... There were some very funny moments (including the band, which was hilarious, and an attempted mugging of a blind man, the results of which also had me laughing) but most of the humour was lost in the drag of this plodding film. And when the end came it was a horrid finish! I'd give it a 1/10 if I hadn't actually enjoyed any part of it, but as it stands I can rate it no higher than a three. 3/10.
41724_u	"Lucia, played by veteran actress and foreign film diva Cecilia Roth, is your typical rite-of-passage character. Through the events surrounding the disappearance of her husband, Lucia discovers a new side of herself she hasn't felt due to the freedom of being unmarried and unrestricted. Is it her womaness, her sexuality, her independence she finds? Bingo! You guessed right. The movie wouldn't be so bad if it actually showed her character development from a more personal-inner perspective ... but the journey is clouded through the integration of two men in her life and a weak plot that just seems to drag on and on and on ... at least that's how you feel when the so called ""mystery"" is solved. It's like you sat through the whole movie for no reason at all ... Roth's acting is good ... although bit overkill on the crying scenes ... the actor who plays Felix is a bit distracting ... facial expressions and lines are given unnaturally, and the other man, her young-love toy, is nothing more than slight eye-candy to hormonal admirers.<br /><br />In short, the plot is fairly original, but not well executed, circular camera shots confuse the audience, the comedy is a bit dry and weak, the drama is a bit heavy, and the acting is moderate. This movie gets four stars (****) ... had Cecilia Roth not been in it, it would have received (**) ... she is the only redeeming value of this flick.<br /><br />-Daine-"
41725_u	I went to see Boogeyman with my buddy and thought it was the worst movie ever (1 person dies). Until he put on Silent Scream (VHS)when we got back. After 17 minutes into the movie the guy in the peach pant I was able to count out the change in his pocket. He had .53 cents in his right pocket. That was the point of argument that he actually had .55 cents which he had 2 quarts and 1 nickle. His pant were so tight that he could squeeze 2 dimes and a nickle out of a quarter. But I recommend this movie to your buddies whom you don't like. I mean that the person that you really want to waist 2 hrs of his/her time. This movie sucked so bad that I had nightmares only on the guy with peach paints.
41726_u	"Pretty dull. Some somewhat Argentoesque aspects, like the opening, which seems like a flashback (it's not) and a long tracking shot. Psycho hangs over this film more obviously, though, with a sinister mother character, a wimpy young man, voyeurism - and a psychoesque murder, as well as music clearly stolen from Psycho's shower scene.<br /><br />Some memorable images, but an unmemorable film unworthy of a second viewing.<br /><br />My reasoning for seeing it was a bit odd. I recall having seen in the late 1970s or early 1980s an advertisement/public service announcement, promo, or trailer of some kind on TV. This would almost certainly have been network TV, since we didn't have cable. Camera was zooming in going up a narrow white staircase, I believe there was a heartbeat on the soundtrack, and the camera might have zoomed in on a vent on one of the walls in the staircase. I believe there was a voice-over saying something about a ""silent scream."" Visually, that's all it was - camera zooming up a staircase.<br /><br />I thought it was possible, and it was also suggested to me on either IMDb's I Need to Know or Horror message boards, that this was a trailer for Silent Scream (1980). However, there was not a staircase like that in the movie, and unfortunately no trailer was included on the video. For some reason, I also wonder if it could have been a fire safety promo, or an antiabortion ad.<br /><br />So, even though I'm not keen to watch the movie again, I would like to see the TV trailers for it!"
41727_u	"Four college students rent rooms at an old, creepy looking sea side house, run by an elderly woman and her rather reclusive son. Unbeknownst to them a mysterious stalker hiding somewhere in the house quietly watches and preys upon them one by one in typical slasher fashion.<br /><br />This movie would have been plenty creepy if there was some payoff every so often, but unfortunately it just keeps building up and building up to a climax that is neither particularly scary or surprising. It does have a few good moments here and there, such as a close-up of the unseen killer peering through a vent, or secretly breaking into the cobweb ridden crawlspace, but these moment are ultimately swallowed up by the relentlessly tedious pace. The cast does it's best with the material but there's simply nothing for them to work with. Balding, who shows plenty of charisma in her next film ""The Boogens"", is completely wasted in a thankless role that gives her little more to do other than stand around looking cute in spite of ridiculous looking clothes.<br /><br />4 out of 10, despite otherwise creepy direction this film is just too long, tedious and uneventful to hold you interest."
41728_u	Silent Scream starts with one of the most annoying opening sequences I've seen in a while. An entire scene involving police pulling up outside, going into, searching & making a gruesome discovery in the attic of a large Mansion is shown in highly irritating slow-motion & seems to go on forever. Not a good start, only a few minutes in & Silent Scream has already got on my nerves! Silent Scream then goes into flashback as the story which leads to this event is told. Student Scotty Parker (Rebecca Balding) has transfered to Santa Rey College at very short notice & once enrolled she sets about finding a room to stay in. After no luck searching Scotty comes across an old Victorian Mansion situated high on some cliffs above the sea & beach whose owners, Mrs. Engels (Yvonne De Carlo) & her geeky weird son Mason (Brad Rearden) rent their spare rooms out to students just like Scotty. Already living there are two more students named Doris Prichart (Juli Andelman) & Jack Towne (Steve Doubet). Scotty accepts one of two available rooms, the other is taken by another student named Peter Ransom (John Widelock) at the same time. That night the four new friends decide to go out to dinner. On their way back home a drunk Peter, after being a jerk, gets left behind & is murdered. His body is discovered the next morning, Lieutenant Sandy McGiver (Cameron Mitchell) & his partner Sergeant Manny Ruggin (Avery Schreiber) are on the case. They question Scotty, Doris & Jack but get nowhere, they then decide to investigate the Engels family to see if they can dig something up on them. Eventually they do but are they in time to save the students from a dark secret that has been hidden for years!<br /><br />Executive produced, co-written & directed by Denny Harris I thought Silent Scream was a waste of time & throughly unimpressive. The script by Harris, Wallace C.Bennett, Jim Wheat & Ken Wheat is extremely slow, nothing significant happens for long stretches. It's over half an hour of tedium, poor character development & scene setting before anything that even resembles horror takes place. The body count is extremely low with just one death for over an hour! The ending was also a big disappointment with a dull so-called shocking revelation that really isn't anything like being shocking, surprising or interesting. In fact Silent Scream ends as you would expect it to, I honestly thought the filmmakers would have tried to come up with a twist ending & catch potential viewers out but no such luck unfortunately. Forget about any blood or gore, just a few red splashes on curtains, clothes & walls & while watching the end credits I noticed there wasn't any special effects credit listed which tells you everything you need to know! There is a sex scene but no explicit nudity. Technically Silent Scream isn't too bad, the house & locations used look OK even if the talentless Harris can't evoke any kind of atmosphere from them & generally speaking it's adequately made throughout although it ain't going to exactly knock your socks off. Acting is alright, there are some genre veterans in here including Yvonne De Carlo, Cameron Mitchell & Barbara Steele. Overall Silent Scream at best is merely watchable as there is nothing really wrong with it I suppose, but at worst it sucks because it's far too slow, uneventful & nothing of interest really happens for most of it's running time. Unfortunately for both me & Silent Scream the negative aspects of the film easily outweighed the positive, better luck next time chaps. The more I think about it the more I think Silent Scream would have worked a lot better as a half an hour Tales from the Crypt (1989 - 1996) episode. There are much better horror films available, watch one of those instead.
41729_u	"Spoilers<br /><br />SILENT SCREAM ain't much of a movie. I call it a micro-movie because the cast is populated by a few actors. There's only one setting. It takes place entirely inside a big but cramped house, and a lot of the action during the climax occurs in the attic. And the body count (aside from the killers' deaths) is only 2! Yep, 2. That has got to be the lowest body count for a slasher in horror movie history. To make things even more underwhelming, the murder scenes for those two aren't very good. What's really funny is as low as the body count is, the story boasts not 1, not 2 but 3 psychos/potential killers (the mother, the woman played by Barbara Steele and the ""young"" nerdy guy). The flashback is confusing and the film starts with, get this, the actual end of the movie, which basically shows us dead people lying on the floor. We don't know who's who on the first viewing but still, what a boring a lazy way to start a horror film. All in all, I have to say that this micro-movie was not worth watching."
41730_u	"After seeing writer-director Dylan McCormick's debut film, ""Four Lane Highway"" at the TriBeCa Film Festival, I can safely say that it quite possibly one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It is in essence a schlocky romance film that pulls out every awful cliché in the book.<br /><br />An irritating Fred Weller plays Sean, the son of a famous writer who was so discouraged by his father that he is wasting his life as a bartender and construction worker in a small Maine college town. Sean was allegedly a great writer just like his dad, but decided to give it up after his dad gave told him that he lacked talent. After a hard day on the job (boo-hoo), Sean decides to go to New York to reclaim his one true love, Molly, played by Greer Goodman on autopilot. Enter Sean's drunken, tag-along buddy, Lyle (Reg Rogers), one of many completely pointless characters; his only function is to be an alcoholic and a source of unfunny comic relief. Unfortunately for him, Rogers turns in the best performance in the film as this useless and underwritten character. Lyle's jokes are the only ones in the film that might produce at least a slight snicker.<br /><br />In New York, Sean finds Molly, apparently a successful painter, and does the whole ""I Want You Back"" song and dance. This is where yet another pointless character, Sasha (Elizabeth Rodriguez) is introduced. She has some sort of an undefined problem where it is obvious that she is depressed and sleeps around, yet it is never actually explained. Her story is one of many dropped subplots. Once Molly and Sean finally hook up, it somehow causes Sean to realize exactly what is wrong with his life, and you can pretty much guess where it goes from there. Their entire passionless love affair is told through a series of confusing flashbacks periodically through the movie. <br /><br />In sum, ""Four Lane Highway"" is full of two things that should never be in movies: tons of clichés and tons of plot holes. It is confusing and boring. Moving at an incredibly sluggish pace it is the longest 109 minutes of your life. If this movie is lucky enough to get a distributor, which it does not deserve, do not waste your time and money seeing it."
